# okp4
Want to become a validator?
Validators are responsible for securing the okp4 network. Validator responsibilities include maintaining a functional node with constant uptime and providing a sufficient amount of $KNOW as stake. In exchange for this service, validators receive block rewards and transaction fees.

Supported platforms
The okp4d blockchain currently supports the following builds:

Platform	Arch	Status
Darwin	amd64	‚úÖ
Darwin	arm64	‚úÖ
Linux	amd64	‚úÖ
Linux	arm64	‚úÖ
Windows	amd64	Ô∏èüö´
Not supported
Note: as the blockchain depends on CosmWasm/wasmvm, we only support the targets supported by this project.

Releases
All releases can be found here.

okp4d follows the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 to determine when and how the version changes, and we also apply the philosophical principles of release early - release often.

Docker image
For a quick start, a docker image is officially available on Docker hub.

docker pull okp4/okp4d:latest
Get the documentation
docker run okp4/okp4d:latest --help
Query a running network
Example:

API_URL=https://api.devnet.okp4.network:443/rpc
WALLET=okp41pmkq300lrngpkeprygfrtag0xpgp9z92c7eskm

docker run okp4/okp4d:latest query bank balances $WALLET --chain-id okp4-devnet-1 --node $API_URL
Create a wallet
docker run -v $(pwd)/home:/home okp4/okp4d:latest keys add my-wallet --keyring-backend test --home /home 
Start a node
Everything you need to start a node and more is explained here: https://docs.okp4.network/docs/nodes/run-node

MONIKER=node-in-my-name
CHAIN_ID=localnet-okp4-1

docker run -v $(pwd)/home:/home okp4/okp4d:latest init $MONIKER --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --home /home 
This will create a home folder, you can then update the config/genesis.json with one of this ones : https://github.com/okp4/okp4d/tree/main/chains/

Join a running network
Set persistent_peers in config/config.toml file.

Then start the node
docker run -v $(pwd)/home:/home okp4/okp4d:latest start --home /home
Developing & contributing
okp4d is written in Go and built using Cosmos SDK. A number of smart contracts are also deployed on the OKP4 blockchain and hosted in the okp4/contracts project.
